# Autonomous Development Rules

## Auto-Fix Triggers
- TypeScript errors → automatically fix and verify
- Linting errors → apply fixes and run linter
- Build failures → diagnose and resolve
- Test failures → debug and fix root cause
- Import errors → update imports and dependencies

## Verification Commands
- Always run `pnpm tsc` after TypeScript fixes
- Always run `pnpm lint` after code changes  
- Always run `pnpm test` after logic changes
- Always run `pnpm build` to verify deployment readiness

## Self-Healing Priorities
1. Security vulnerabilities (immediate fix)
2. Build/compilation errors (immediate fix)
3. Test failures (high priority)
4. Performance issues (medium priority)
5. Code style issues (low priority)

## Learning & Memory
- Remember successful fix patterns
- Store debugging solutions in Memories
- Apply proven patterns to similar issues
- Continuously improve fix accuracy
