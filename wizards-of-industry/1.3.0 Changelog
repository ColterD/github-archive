The Multiplayer Update!
Hunting and mining dimensions merged with The Beneath mod.
Added content from minecraft patches up to 1.16 with Future MC mod.
FPS improvement when tabbed-out or idle with FPS Reducer.

LycanitesMobs removed just due to the continued trouble of developing with it and replaced with other (better) mods.
Better Diving removed, in the end, I was only using it for its underwater mechanic and for nothing else; seemed a waste.
GottschCore removed mostly because it just isn't needed anymore but also due to an incompatibility with Corail Tombstone.
Plus-TiC removed due to the author sabotaging his own code.  See more here: https://tinyurl.com/y9e92nkj
