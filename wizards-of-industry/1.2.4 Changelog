v1.2.4

Important Changes:
- Forestry and Bees are gone!  So many mods for so little gain.  Bees are cool, but if genetically modifying animals for materials is something people want, theres a more modern and compact alternative.
- JourneyMap has been removed and replaced by Xaero's Minimap.  Provides same functionality, just a cleaner mod.  You may have lost your waypoints.  You will need to readd them.
- TexFix has been removed for a few things that it fixes by it being gone.  If you use large (256+) resolution texture packs, you can reinstall TexFix manually as it'll help you deal with performance.

- Puddles
