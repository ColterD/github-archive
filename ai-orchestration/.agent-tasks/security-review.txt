Conduct comprehensive security analysis using Snyk and manual review.

**Scope:**
- Run Snyk code scan on all source files (EXCLUDE /reorganization/)
- Run Snyk SCA scan on dependencies
- Review docker-compose.yml for security issues
- Check for exposed secrets/credentials
- Analyze authentication/authorization patterns

**Snyk Configuration:**
Add to .snyk file:
```
exclude:
  - Github/reorganization/**
```

**Tasks:**
1. Run: snyk code test --exclude=Github/reorganization/
2. Run: snyk test (dependency scan)
3. Review environment variables and secrets management
4. Check for hardcoded credentials
5. Analyze Docker security (ports, volumes, networks)

**Deliverables:**
1. Snyk scan reports
2. Security vulnerability summary
3. Risk assessment with severity levels
4. Remediation recommendations

CRITICAL: Exclude Github/reorganization/ from ALL scans
