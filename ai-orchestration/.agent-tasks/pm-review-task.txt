You are the Project Manager agent coordinating a comprehensive review of the AI_Orchestration project.

CRITICAL: Exclude the /reorganization/ directory entirely from all analysis.

**Your Task:**
1. Analyze the entire AI_Orchestration project structure (excluding /reorganization/)
2. Break down the review into specialized tasks for:
   - Code Quality & Architecture Review
   - Security Analysis (use Snyk, exclude /reorganization/)
   - Documentation Audit
   - Dependencies & Configuration Review
   - Test Coverage Assessment

3. Create a JSON task breakdown with:
   - Task ID
   - Agent assignment (architect, qc, devops, janitor)
   - Specific directories/files to review
   - Success criteria

4. Output the task breakdown as structured JSON for orchestration.

**Project Structure to Review:**
- AI_Orchestration/ (root)
  - mimir/ (full MCP server stack)
  - monitoring/ (Grafana, Prometheus)
  - tests/ (Playwright tests)
  - tools/ (Python utilities)
  - *.md files (documentation)
  - *.ps1 files (scripts)
  - docker-compose.yml
  - All configuration files

EXCLUDE: Github/reorganization/ (ignore completely)

**Deliverable:**
Create a comprehensive task breakdown JSON file that other agents can use to execute their reviews in parallel.
